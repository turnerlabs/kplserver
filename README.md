# kplserver

Exposes the [Amazon Kinesis Producer Library](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer) via sockets for
multi-language support.

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/turner/kplserver/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/turner/kplserver)

The KPL is written in Java and designed to be consumed by Java applications. This project may be useful if you're
building a data ingestion app using Kinesis in a language other than Java.

### usage

The server defaults to port `3000` but can be overridden by setting the `PORT` environment variable. Point the server to
your kinesis stream by setting the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and `KINESIS_STREAM` environment variables. Once the server is
up and running, you can send data to Kinesis by opening a socket connection and sending utf-8 data. Each record you send
should be delimited by a new line.

Optionally, you can provide a host (`ERROR_SOCKET_HOST`) and port (`ERROR_SOCKET_PORT`) where any message which cannot
be put in kinesis stream for any reason will be posted.

### docker image

This server is available as a docker image.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e KINESIS_STREAM=my-stream \
  -e ERROR_SOCKET_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
  -e ERROR_SOCKET_PORT=3001 \
  quay.io/turner/kplserver
```

### sidecar

If you're consuming the KPL from an ecs/fargate container, the followning container definitions snippet from a task
definition will configure this server as a sidecar container that you can talk to over sockets via `127.0.0.1:3000`.
